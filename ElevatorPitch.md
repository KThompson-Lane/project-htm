## Brief description of the game
A top-down rogue-like bullet hell game where the player has to clear a series of rooms to reach the floors boss. Upon killing the boss the player progresses to the next floor.
Each room is a unique challenge with a number of different enemies which the player must eliminate through the use of a series of ranged weapons. 
The player must progress quickly, however, as the moment the game begins a timer starts counting down, once it reaches zero the game ends. 
The timer can be extended in a number of ways such as clearing rooms, but the timer is not the only concern to the player, they must also take care not to lose their life to the enemies and bosses residing within the floor.

## Key points
- The game will be in 2D from the top-down POV
- The player will gain a number of upgrades/weapons as they progress through the game
- Once the game ends, all progress is lost, however a record of their score is kept for bragging rights.
- The enemies will progress in difficulty as the floors go on.
- Each 'run' of the game is unique through the use of procedrually generated dungeon floors

## Plot (TBD)
Youâ€™re a cyber-fighter, trying to battle your way through the network, to get to the mainframe. You have to defeat the firewall boss along the way to get access to the mainframe. 
The firewall boss is not the only hazard along the way. You also have to battle off other malicious entities along the way, who have infected the network.
You have a timer, until the mainframe finds you and kicks you out of the network. Clearing each room gives you bonus time.
